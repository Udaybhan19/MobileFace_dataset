# MobileFace_dataset
Our research has been accepted at the ICPR 2024, which work introduces the first large-scale face analysis using the newly proposed MobileFaces dataset. The dataset comprises images and videos captured in real-world, unconstrained environments, featuring varying distances, poses, and resolutions, all recorded using mobile phones.
